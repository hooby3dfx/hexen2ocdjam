This is a Hexen 2 level (not quite a mod) inspired by the theme “What does home mean” for the 2019 Global Game Jam.

The level was created in Trenchbroom. 

To play it you will need a copy of Hexen 2. It is recommended to play with the “Hammer of Thyrion” open source Hexen 2 port. 

Extract the “ocdjam” folder into your Hexen 2 directory. To launch the game, run this command line:
glh2.exe -game ocdjam +map house1
